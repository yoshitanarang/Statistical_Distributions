# Question 4
Suppose that a market research analyst for a cell phone company conducts a study
of their customers who exceed the data allowance included on their basic cell 
phone contract; the analyst finds that for those people who exceed the data 
included in their basic contract, the excess data used follows an exponential
distribution with a mean of 2 Gigabytes (Gb). Consider a random sample of 80 
customers who exceed the data allowance included in their basic cell phone 
contract.

(a) Probability excess data use is larger than 2.5 Gb: 0.2865


(b) Probability excess data used by 80 customers is larger than 2.5 Gb: 0.0127

# Question 5
Implementing a binomial estimate, we are able to model the given 
problem where a student surveyed 30 of her classmates in 2020 & found that 22 
students liked to play video games. In our calculations, it is found that: 
  
  95% confidence interval: [0.5383, 0.8702], & 0.65 is held in the 95% 
  confidence interval

In interpreting our calculations, it can be determined that the proportion of 
adults that liked to play video games in the United States in 2020, is 
demonstrated in our evaluated confidence interval.

# Implement prop.test to test if the proportions in these groups are the same,
